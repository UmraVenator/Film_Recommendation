# Film_Recommendation
Recommendation Process for a film 
Hello GitHub. Here you can a fing a recommendation code for films based on the scores each user has given to a specific movie i wrote the other day in C. In order for the code to work you will need to have a 
txt file named reviews.txt you will need to have 5 users and you will need to have at least 6 movies.You enter the scores(1-10) in a chart and if a user has not seen a movie you enter 100.
The programm is fixed to work only with a fixed reviews.txt which is uploaded already.The movies are Star Wars 1,2,3 and LoTR 1,2,3 and the programm recommends a movie to user Helen(3rd line of chart) cause she
has not seen the movies Star Wars 1 and LoTR 3.Its one of my first tries in writing something like that. So i would like help to make the whole procces more automated and in a way that i can use a custom txt file.
